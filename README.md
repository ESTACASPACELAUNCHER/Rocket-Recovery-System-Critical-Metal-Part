Estaca Space Odyssey is an aerospace/rocketry themed association from the engineering school ESTACA, located next to Paris in France. The association is involved in various projects, from mini-rockets to large experimental rockets. In this article, we will focus on the biggest rocket in development for this year: the ESTACA Space Launcher (ESL). ESL is a program composed of 3 rockets, each one going higher to reach at the end the altitude of 30km with a hybrid rocket engine (liquid + solid). ESL-1 is the first rocket of the program and has the goal to go to an altitude of 3000m and control its roll by ejecting pressurized air on the side. To launch ESL-1, we will be participating in an international launch campaign called C'Space in France, organized by the French Space Agency (CNES).

Each rocket launched needs to be recovered to analyze the data saved during the flight. To recover ESL-1, we use a double parachute system: it consists of a small parachute which will be ejected on the top of the rocket when the rocket is at its highest point to slow down to approximately 30m/s and then a bigger parachute, the main one, ejected at 300m to reach a speed slower than 15m/s to land softly on the ground. To be able to execute our recovery system, we need special metal parts to separate the nose cone and the rest of the rocket to let the parachutes deploy correctly.

In this article, we will discuss in detail the critical metal part of the recovery system, its design, manufacturing, and testing.

### The Recovery System

The recovery system consists of 2 main parts. The first one is the one connected to the nose cone. This part is simple and is just a metal ring with 3 tubes on the bottom. The second is the most complex and the most critical of the system. This part is connected to the rocket, it has 3 springs to eject the metal ring with the nose cone and it has some grooves to guide the tubes of the other metal ring. The system is blocked by tiny metal plates which block the tubes and so the upper metal part. To keep the metal plates on their place, the bottom metal piece has “tunnels”. Connected to the plates we have electrical actuators that raise or lower the plates and allow the tubes and the upper metal ring to be ejected with the help of 3 springs. This part is complex to make with simple CNC machines and it needs to be resistant enough to support the high constraints made by the springs, the vibrations of the launch and the shock of the double deployment. We need a metal piece to overcome all those constraints.

#### Design of the Critical Metal Part

The design of the critical metal part was a challenging task. It had to be strong enough to withstand the forces of the ejection and the landing, yet lightweight enough to not add too much weight to the rocket. The part also had to be designed in such a way that it could be easily manufactured and assembled.

After several iterations, the final design of the critical metal part was completed. It was designed using CAD software, and the final design was exported in the STL format, which is compatible with 3D printers and CNC machines.

#### Manufacturing of the Critical Metal Part

The manufacturing of the other critical metal parts was a complex process. It required the use of CNC machines to mill the part from a solid block of aluminum. The milling process was slow and required a high level of precision to ensure that the part was manufactured to the exact specifications.

After the milling process was completed, the part was inspected for any defects or errors. Any defects or errors were corrected, and the part was then polished to remove any burrs or sharp edges.

#### Assembly of the Recovery System

The assembly of the recovery system was a delicate process. The critical metal part had to be assembled with the other metal ring, the springs, the electrical actuators, and the parachutes. The assembly process required a high level of precision and attention to detail to ensure that the system was assembled correctly and would function as intended.

Once the assembly is completed, the recovery system is tested several times to ensure that it would function correctly during the actual launch and recovery of the rocket.



### Partnership with JLC3DP for SLM 3D Printed Parts

We are thrilled to announce our partnership with JLC3DP(https://jlc3dp.com/?from=estaca), a leading provider of SLM (Selective Laser Melting) 3D printing services. As we mentioned earlier, the critical metal part of our recovery system is complex to make with simple CNC machines and needs to be resistant enough to support high constraints. That's why we decided to opt for SLM 3D printing technology, which allows for the creation of highly complex and durable metal parts.

JLC3DP has been instrumental in the production of the critical metal part of our recovery system. The SLM 3D printing process involves using a high-powered laser to melt and fuse together metal powder particles, layer by layer, until the part is complete. This results in a part that is not only highly detailed but also extremely strong and durable.

Thanks to JLC3DP's state-of-the-art SLM 3D printers and their extensive experience in the field, we will be able to produce the critical metal part of our recovery system in a fraction of the time it would have taken with traditional manufacturing methods. This has allowed us to stay on schedule and ensure that our rocket is ready for launch at the C'Space launch campaign.

We are incredibly grateful for JLC3DP's support and partnership in this project. Their commitment to innovation and quality has been invaluable to us, and we look forward to continuing to work with them in the future.
